			<description><![CDATA[Looking back on a year of gaming, with my first completed campaigns and steps into new game structures.]]></description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A blogwagon initiative started by <a href="https://ladytabletop.wordpress.com/2025/11/30/the-endie-awards/">Lady Tabletop</a> on the Dice Exploder Discord server that&rsquo;s making a bit of waves, and a way for me to unpack and debrief this year of tabletop RPG obsession.</p>
<p>This past year I finally managed to actually run a few campaigns! I&rsquo;d like to have an ongoing, long-term game, for now I&rsquo;m happy to have casual pick-up groups meeting regularly with like-minded freaks.</p>
<h1 id="pointless-stats">Pointless Stats</h1>
<ul>
<li>I played <strong>4 sessions</strong> outdoors. Way to get some fresh air!
<ul>
<li>The climax of my <em>Orbital Blues</em> game was at a riverbank at sunset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I played <strong>2 sessions</strong> online.</li>
<li>I ran <strong>6 different games</strong> this year, including <strong>3 campaigns</strong>.</li>
<li>I played <strong>5 sessions</strong> without a dedicated GM.</li>
<li>I recorded playing <strong>19 different games</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="campaigns-completed">Campaigns Completed</h1>
<p>For this list, a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; is a series of connected games that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were played with a closed table (every player at every session)</li>
<li>had a dedicated session zero</li>
<li>played more than one session</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cyberpunk-red">Cyberpunk RED</h2>
<p>My favorite part of <em>RED</em> is easily the setting: Night City in the Time of the Red is when corporations are at their weakest, yet still have a finger in just about every aspect of life. The Dark Future has advanced, and now features AI assistant smartphones with the possibility of viral internet fame. I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of the system, even after playing for over a year I still needed to consult skill descriptions and pull up the to-hit table every combat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kinda burned on crunchy trad games and skill list games after this one &ndash; we had a lot of play culture clashes, communication issues, and asymmetric knowledge (players knew setting and rules better than GM) that kept us from having the most fun. But, we finished it, and that&rsquo;s more than I can say for a lot of other campaigns I&rsquo;ve been a part of.</p>
<h2 id="orbital-blues">Orbital Blues</h2>
<p>This was a new game for everyone involved, and while the players were more than eager to meet me halfway (one built the crew&rsquo;s spaceplane in <em>Kerbel Space Program</em> and got it to reach orbit!) I wasn&rsquo;t completely comfortable with the system or the sandbox in the back of the book I dropped them into for the first few sessions. Giving it a bit of time (and more aggressive Blues checks), we discovered the system was lightweight and easy to work with. As the crew caused chaos, the sandbox reacted, and pieces fell into place, giving us a story of our very own. After 6 sessions, we had an explosive climax and some very sad space cowboys skipping town.</p>
<h2 id="star-wars-d20">Star Wars d20</h2>
<p><em>Andor</em> S2 got one of my friends thinking things, and we did a spy thriller one (three) shot set on Courscant. I wanted to play <em>WEG Star Wars</em>, but our characters definitely didn&rsquo;t have that amount of plot armor. We trad game&rsquo;d this one &ndash; I know for a fact the guy running this didn&rsquo;t read the skills chapter (we used Advantage at some point). Definitely not my style.</p>
<p>Regardless of the system, playing Star Wars with classic extended universe lore is fun. (Also <em>Andor</em> is excellent.)</p>
<h2 id="the-wildsea">The Wildsea</h2>
<p><em>Wildsea&rsquo;s</em> setting and culture drew me to the game, and the flexible core system kept me coming back. Twists are an excellent addition to the <em>FitD</em> dice pool, and you can steal them for any similar game. Our Wildsailors got pulled into a bait &amp; switch situation as they discovered an analog horror deadmall straight from the 90&rsquo;s. This caused a ton of dramatic irony for the players as we knew exactly what was happening but our sailors lacked any context. While the cultures and sailing loop might not have been relevant in the depths of the mysterious pre-V mall, the game as a whole is incredibly charming, and the table is clamoring for more.</p>
<h2 id="daggerheart">Daggerheart</h2>
<p>I played a short campaign using the Age of Umbra campaign frame and ran a one (two) shot using the generator in the book and some tables from <em>Worlds Without Number</em>.</p>
<p>In short: this game isn&rsquo;t a trad game, it&rsquo;s a narrative game with a bunch of abilities like those you&rsquo;d find in a trad game. As a certified <em>WoDu</em> freak, this was like catnip to me: I get to do my usual gimmick and make up enemy abilities on the fly, spending Fear to justify it to the players; and players get to chose from cool abilities and have the ultimate plot armor: no-selling death. The one-shot was the best kind of chaos, and involving the players in the worldbuilding resulted in a strange land we found compelling.</p>
<p>The campaign was more of a mixed bag: the GM seemed to be expecting the game to operate like a trad game and it doesn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> work that way. We had a bit of difficulty getting into real trouble (nobody made a death move, despite my best efforts), but I did get some juicy melodrama as my wizard&rsquo;s former student came back looking for blood, and that&rsquo;s enough to keep me hooked. For next time, I&rsquo;ll need to make drama more directly plot-relevant and hooked to another PC, possibly in a PC-NPC-PC triangle.</p>
<h1 id="open-table-campaigns">Open table campaigns</h1>
<p>A format new to me this year: a series of RPG sessions with an interconnected story and characters, but not necessarily the same players. A casual, drop in, drop out experience.</p>
<h2 id="fist">FIST</h2>
<p>I ran the reality-twisting, fractal-infused <em>Mandelbrot Set</em> campaign over three sessions and absolutely loved it. The recent revisions make it easier to run, and it&rsquo;s jammed full of absolutely bizarre situations for the squad to run into. You will be shocked as FIST finds ever new and creative ways to engage the enemy, using tools from one reality to solve problems in another.</p>
<p>For a one-shot, I ran mathematical thriller <em>House of Cards and Numbers</em> where FIST infiltrates a casino run by a sinister organization. Great fun with tons of opportunity for shenanigans, <em>Hitman Trilogy</em> style. Turns into an action-packed train chase and snowy mountainside escape in back half. (We were running short on time so I had to cut out the third act entirely!) Plenty of tactical options available to players at all times, and procedure and NPC behaviors, including a full-on villain monologue I encouraged my players to skip when they got bored (they did not get bored). <a href="https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/house-of-cards-and-numbers">Free on Itch.</a></p>
<p>I still love <em>FIST</em>: I&rsquo;ll bust it out at every opportunity. The high camp inspirations of Metal Gear and The A-Team combine with the flexible <em>WoDu</em> chassis to let just about anything be possible while still keeping enough grit to be threatening. You can complete the mission by running in guns blazing, but it&rsquo;ll take a few mercs, and you want to keep the one you started with, right?</p>
<h2 id="yazebas-bed--breakfast">Yazeba&rsquo;s Bed &amp; Breakfast</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how effective &ldquo;rule 1: the rules don&rsquo;t really matter that much, just relax and have fun&rdquo; was, but when there&rsquo;s no way to get injured or die, the art is fun, and the game is described as a lost collection of fanfics with some chapters missing&hellip; yeah, just relax and have fun, run the game on vibes. Who cares if we&rsquo;re exactly following the rules, they&rsquo;re just fun prompts to get character moments. I guess what I&rsquo;m getting at is, <a href="https://possumcreek.medium.com/rules-are-a-cage-and-im-a-puppygirl-69e8d569b2b6">sometimes I want a cage that says &ldquo;have fun!&rdquo; on it</a>.</p>
<p>I loved this game, and I can&rsquo;t wait to play more of it. Every session grows more and more resonant in my mind.</p>
<h2 id="brindlewood-bay">Brindlewood Bay</h2>
<p>I only knew about the show-stopping Theorize roll going in, and&hellip; for a casual, low-prep, pick-up game, it&rsquo;s excellent! It perfectly sells the fantasy of watching some kinda trashy detective show you can&rsquo;t get enough of, and in the moment the dream logic of RPG&rsquo;s makes everything gel together. We&rsquo;re still dialing in the core gameplay loop, the Meddling roll, and the various Crowns, but I&rsquo;m excited to see what the Murder Mavens get up to next. The official scenarios are also hilarious and ripe for meddling.</p>
<h2 id="2400-junior-hybrid-battle-cryptids">2400: Junior Hybrid Battle Cryptids</h2>
<p>This was a surprise hit with my one-shot group: <em>2400</em> is incredibly easy to pick up and play, this microgame&rsquo;s theme is broadly appealing (eve-RY bo-DY knows THIS ca~-DENCE), and we were quickly able to whip up a bickering family of cryptids who discover plot hooks everywhere they look. I ran this GM-less with a bunch of random oracles (guess I&rsquo;m collecting those now), with the core system and tables giving us a ton to work with. Doing an <strong>awful</strong> freestyle bar then rolling a fistful of cubes was a highlight.</p>
<h1 id="one-shots">One-Shots</h1>
<p>Any RPG session that was intended to be a standalone or didn&rsquo;t get renewed for a second session.</p>
<h2 id="ruins--rogues">Ruins &amp; Rogues</h2>
<p>Tim B.&rsquo;s lightweight dungeon crawling system, featuring a cute core mechanic. I was able to quickly get a weird blorbo and send them into a dungeon, hoping for their survival. In true OSR fashion, fighting isn&rsquo;t the best way to resolve fights, and the answer to most problems wasn&rsquo;t on our character sheet. I played this online and ran into some awkwardness with the delay (plus I realized halfway through I was spoiled on the adventure, whoops), but I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to more of this. I&rsquo;d take it over <em>B/X</em>!</p>
<h2 id="5e-24">5e &lsquo;24</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for me, proximity to <em>5e</em> players means sometimes I have to play <em>5e</em>. (I wanted to play <em>Monster of the Week</em> but the table was full.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I randomly selected a pregen Rogue and got settled in with some funny banter (sentai themed game). I got bored very quickly in combat when it took 30 minutes (!!) for a turn to get back to me. I did get some help from the table to find good bits, but there&rsquo;s only so many ways we could find to describe Attack then Hide.</p>
<p>Bless <em>5e</em> players, they&rsquo;re stronger than me. In spite of my gripes, I had some fun. You think I&rsquo;m gonna turn down the chance to make anime dub noises then scream-whisper <em><strong>&ldquo;SNEAK ATTACK!!!&rdquo;</strong></em>?</p>
<h2 id="pokeymanz">Pokeymanz</h2>
<p>We were doing a Mystery Dungeon type game and I didn&rsquo;t know who the lore characters were, so I just followed the rest of the table&rsquo;s lead until we got into a fight. Character creation was a lot of fun, and delightfully easy. The Savage Worlds exploding dice and the goofiness of being a talking animal thing was more than enough entertainment for me.</p>
<p>I wanted the Blaziken to Blaze Kick my Spheal at something &ndash; just the image is making me grin.</p>
<h2 id="level-up-advanced-5e">Level Up: Advanced 5e</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s <em>5e</em> with funky dice for skills. We did the <em>Voidrunner</em> science fantasy (<em>Wars</em> coded) setting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Definitely not what I&rsquo;m looking for, at least with a pregen in a pre-planned plot. We had Long Rests after every fight so there was no tension.</p>
<p>I appreciate the additional options everyone gets! Some of them are kinda fun, and they&rsquo;re effects-based, giving me a fun prompt to explain how my pilot character dodges the laser blasts heading his way.</p>
<h2 id="mothership">Mothership</h2>
<p>This was an impromptu game set up at the last minute, using material from a handful of sourcebooks smashed together. While we didn&rsquo;t make an aggressive number of panic checks, we did poke around the vacuum-sealed location until there was nothing left to do but Risky RPG Hijinks, leading to an encounter with an alien! Miraculously, our last shotgun shell took it down long enough for us to escape in one piece. Problem-solving with common sense while risking death was a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Also someone put the Speed Sandwich in here. Nice!</p>
<h2 id="monster-of-the-week">Monster of the Week</h2>
<p>A cheeky little pick-up one shot, using the new playbooks. It&rsquo;s great fun! While I didn&rsquo;t seek out chances to use my Monstrous playbook moves until the climax&hellip; I used them to create a third act twist and set up a bizarre mystery TV show, which is exactly what I was looking for. I&rsquo;d love to check this game out in a longer campaign &ndash; it&rsquo;s a PbtA favorite, after all.</p>
<h2 id="golden-sky-stories">Golden Sky Stories</h2>
<p>We had a drastic setting change to a Rankin/Bass style holiday special, which combined with a large table unfamiliar with the rules to result in what I think was not the intended play experience. But, I was charmed by the rules snippets I did see, and I was more than happy to meet the game halfway. Next time, I&rsquo;d like to play with a smaller group with the setting in the book, and focus on warming the hearts of children.</p>
<h2 id="draw-steel">Draw Steel</h2>
<p>The only note I wrote for this game was &ldquo;forced movement gud.&rdquo; This is all you need to know to play the game with decent efficiency.</p>
<p>I wound up liking this game a lot more than I thought I would, given my gripes about <em>5e</em> above, but I had a large number of options available to me, and even if &ldquo;kick&rdquo; was my most used Maneuver, I had to carefully position every time to ensure I was kicking for maximum damage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fun worldbuilding in the rules text, particularly in the character backgrounds and motivations. It&rsquo;s an aggressively opinionated game, which I found engaging and exciting.</p>
<h2 id="remix">Remix</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still kinda obsessed with the <em>WoDu</em> family, the child of <em>Basic D&amp;D</em> and the 2d6+mod thing from <em>Apocalypse World</em>. However, the mechanics-adverse group I played with didn&rsquo;t want to bother reading any lists that went past one page, or roll for stats, so this was a miss for them. I&rsquo;m still on the hunt for the right group for this, one as obsessed with <em>FIST</em> as me.</p>
<h2 id="oh-captain-my-captain">Oh Captain My Captain</h2>
<p>My first time playing a GM-less, prompt-based game! This was&hellip; actually a lot of fun. Using a generous amount of &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; or &ldquo;no, but&rdquo;, we were able to spin a captivating tale of our captain of industry looking for one last grand stock market pump &amp; dump scheme in a cross between <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Succession</em>, ending with our captain betraying us for a cabinet position in the White House. (Really hope this doesn&rsquo;t become too topical in the near future.)</p>
<p>This game&rsquo;s great, and since it&rsquo;s diceless and does character creation on the fly, you can pull it out and play with any group of friends. I&rsquo;ll see about twisting the arms of folks to play a bit more frequently.</p>
<h1 id="superlatives">Superlatives</h1>
<h2 id="next-years-campaign">Next year&rsquo;s campaign</h2>
<p>Not necessarily a game I played this year - I&rsquo;ve been getting hopped up on the collaborative worldbuilding and DIY elfgame juice, and with the right table (I can probably assemble it from the players around me) there&rsquo;s some exciting collaborative gaming on the horizon for me.</p>
<p>Games I could use for this campaign include <em>Daggerheart</em>, <em>Nimble</em>, <em>World of Dungeons Remix</em>, <em>Fabula Ultima</em>, or maybe <em>Vagabond</em> or <em>Dragon Slayers</em> or a <em>2400</em> hack.</p>
<h2 id="next-one-shot">Next one shot</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be <em>2400</em>. I was skeptical when the Itch page said &ldquo;if you grabbed a game you could be playing by now&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s right! It&rsquo;s the essence of <em>Into the Odd</em> with just enough rules to keep us on the same page. There&rsquo;s a bunch of microgames included, and the associated community&rsquo;s made quite a few hacks to choose from, so I&rsquo;m confident I can match whatever mood comes my way.</p>
<h2 id="best-gm-experience">Best GM experience</h2>
<p>Out of the various games I ran, I had the best time running <em>Mandelbrot Set</em>. Maybe I&rsquo;m on the same wavelength as CLAYMORE, maybe the weird fractal setting excused any weirdness that cropped up, but I spent maybe 10 minutes rolling on tables before each session and had hours of fascinating material ready to go. Excellent for open tables and dedicated campaigns &ndash; offer unlockable Fractal Traits to make PC&rsquo;s even weirder.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[A package of variant rules for D&D 2014 (and D&D 2024) for a simpler, more streamlined game.]]></description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wx3rxBcqC3OxlITgtT3iubx8x-doOWdmC1K3qw6vAf4/edit">Original Doc</a> by <a href="https://deldon.itch.io">deldon</a>. Text has been edited by Window Dump.</p>
<p>This is a curated collection of the official optional rules in <em>D&amp;D 2014</em> (aka <em>5e &lsquo;14</em>) culled from the <em>DMG</em> and <em>PHB</em> to create a simpler, more streamlined game. These rules should be compatible with many other similar games including <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> (<em>5e &lsquo;24</em>), <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, and <em>Level Up!: Advanced 5e</em>.</p>

        <div class="admonition-content"><p>Additions to the original text are in these helpful admonition boxes. <em>Slappers Only!</em> was created as a variant using rules text in <em>5e &lsquo;14</em> as a high concept joke. I think crowbarring in more OSR tech is fun in most games, and <em>5e</em> refuses to disagree with anyone on anything, so more OSR tech it is!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few changes in <em>5e &lsquo;24</em> I noticed and liked, which I call out in these admonitions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The DM describes the environment</li>
<li>The players describe what they want to do</li>

<p>A <strong>Short Rest</strong> is 10 minutes of catching your breath and tending to injuries. You can spend Hit Dice to recover HP, one at a time, rolling them and adding your CON to determine the recovered HP.</p>
<p>A <strong>Field Rest</strong> is 8 hours of sleep and a meal and counts as a Short Rest. You can spend Hit Dice to recover HP, taking the maximum value for each expended Hit Die, adding your CON to die as usual.</p>
<p>A <strong>Safe Rest</strong> is an overnight rest in a safe location designated by the DM and counts as a Long Rest. Safe locations could include lodging at an inn, or some other protected or hidden spot like an oasis, a sacred shrine, etc. Recover all spent HP, Hit Dice, Spell Slots, failed Death Saves, and other class resources.</p>
<p>For a gritter feel, a Safe Rest may require a full week of rest or only restore one failed Death Save.</p>

<p>There are many, many rules that this system removes from the normal system of character creation that happens throughout play. These mechanics can still be added to characters, but it is up to the player of the character to communicate to the DM if they are seeking these mechanics (such as a feat or higher level spell) so the DM can tie the mechanic to a fictional source (such as a tutor, or library of forbidden arcane knowledge) and place it in the campaign world.</p>
<p>The DM is also of course at the liberty to place any number of mechanical boons throughout the world, but should do so in a manner that compliments the fiction.</p>

<p>The pamphlet started coming together when I made the spread on the inside. It features a relatively novel floor generator and tables to use with it.</p>
<h3 id="dungeon-generator">Dungeon generator</h3>
<p>This dungeon generator was inspired by two dungeon generators: the method in &ldquo;O5R&rdquo; TTRPG <a href="https://www.fivetorchesdeep.com">Five Torches Deep</a> and the one in <a href="https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Rogue">Rogue</a>, that game that all those other games are kinda like. <em>Rogue</em> was inspired by early <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, much like the OSR, but without all the hindsight.</p>
<p><em>Five Torches Deep</em> features a small dungeon generator where you shuffle a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, then roll it like a d6 and interpret the results. Each color represents a different type of room, like entrances, traps, treasure, etc. I realized this theoretically gives similar results to rolling a d6 for each cell on a 3x3 grid (cubes are cubes, right?). What if we rolled 9 dice and smushed them together into a 3x3 grid? And what if we used different colored dice? There&rsquo;s a dungeon generator.</p>
<p><em>Rogue</em> generates a floor by creating a 3x3 grid of random rooms. <a href="https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue/blob/master/rooms.c#L31">Exact logic</a>: up to 3 rooms are marked as &ldquo;gone&rdquo; (simply not there); rooms have a (dungeon level - 1) in 10 chance to be a dark room, and a 1 in 15 chance for a dark room to be a maze (random twisty passages), otherwise they&rsquo;re open lit rooms; rooms have a 50% chance to contain gold, and a 25% chance to contain a monster &ndash; 80% if the room contains gold too. I had to look up these exact numbers, but I&rsquo;ve played a bit of <em>Rogue</em> &ndash; enough to get bored with its level generator because I&rsquo;m spoiled by <em>Diablo</em> &ndash; and remembered the gist of how it worked.</p>
<p>Using two colors of dice adds the same effect as &ldquo;gone&rdquo; rooms to <em>Five Torches Deep</em>, at the cost of only one more D6 table!</p>
<p>The real meat is the table entries, little prompts for what&rsquo;s in the room. There&rsquo;s no overarching plot here, instead hints of strange things happening or opportunities to cause trouble. This could provide a jumping-off point for a further campaign (pick something the players latch onto) or a diversion from another game.</p>
<p>An expanded version could demonstrate what prepping this actually looks like. The stocking procedures are <em>not</em> playtested. I also don&rsquo;t clarify what the exit doors look like - I was imaging picking an exterior wall (or interior to be weird) and deciding that wall had the exit.</p>
<h3 id="other-procedures">Other procedures</h3>
<p>For an OSR dungeon crawling experience, I added a few lightweight procedures to create time pressure and resource drains.</p>
<p><a href="https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html">The Underclock</a> is a simple way to provide random encounters at random intervals. I stripped it down to use D6&rsquo;s only and focus on the current floor, renaming it the CYBERCLOCK. It acts as a &ldquo;hurry up&rdquo; mechanic like those in arcade games &ndash; linger around and you&rsquo;ll get into trouble. You can expect a random encounter once every four times the CYBERCLOCK ticks down. On average, you can explore 12 rooms before a &ldquo;boss&rdquo; shows up, and since a floor has up to 9 rooms, that should provide enough time to explore and move on. Of course, the clock also ticks down when you cause chaos&hellip;</p>
<p>I get extra use out of the encounter table to populate rooms with extra weirdos. I even have a two-line reaction roll in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simple resource drainer when you move between floors to incentivize players to search every room, and maybe make a tough decision or two. There are two new resources, TOKENS (a currency, for dealing with Daemons) and PARITY BITS (for moving between floors). The floor transmission procedure drains PARITY BITS or other resources on low rolls, higher rolls lower the CYBERCLOCK to give you less time to explore.</p>

        <div class="admonition-content"><p>Floor transmission and reaction rolls use a single D6 with higher results favoring players, so players can get maximum value from using a WAR DIE on the roll. Referees could inform players of this. (WAR DICE are consumable D6&rsquo;s each operative has that may be added to <em>any</em> roll.)</p>
<p>I recommend designing new procedures for <em>FIST</em> like the CHOKE score: roll a D6, higher values are &ldquo;better&rdquo; or at least funnier.</p>
</div>
    </aside>
<h2 id="layout-experiments">Layout experiments</h2>
<p>I wanted to do as much as I could with just text and typography, and the built-in features of Typst. Partly because I&rsquo;m lazy, but also to focus on one tool at a time. So, this project has lots of lists and tables in various formats, trying to be eye-catching and pleasing without being distracting. I also took some hints from the <em>FIST</em> book, notably the black bars for section headings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with the dungeon generator spread. I&rsquo;m also pleased with the light gray accent panels and sections. The other side is kinda whatever. I like the logo, see below for details on how I made it.</p>
<p>The funny gradient around the logo is a placeholder that never got replaced. I wanted to warp some Unix source code around it, like <em>The Matrix</em> but a lot dorkier. I also wanted to hack up some graphics of what the Ideaspace looks like (what if <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> had <em>four colors</em> and a polygon budget in the dozens) and what the Daemons look like (they&rsquo;re literally just the little imp dudes from <em>Zero Punctuation</em>). I decided graphics were out of scope for this project.</p>
<h1 id="source-code-discussion">Source code discussion</h1>
<p>I wrote this with <a href="https://typst.app">Typst</a>! This was a big step up from my earlier projects. My initial idea was to create an ARPANET pointcrawl, then remembered I don&rsquo;t know how to make adventures or pointcrawls and scaled back my plans. I was strongly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/dodgepong/typst-ha-corvette-job/">dodgepong&rsquo;s Typst conversion of the HA Corvette Job</a> and <a href="https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/rations-collection">CLAYMORE&rsquo;s RATIONS collection</a> &ndash; a trifold pamphlet seemed perfect for a jam. Two pages, six panels. A bit of hacking and I was ready to actually write the thing, directly into the layout.</p>
<h2 id="font-choice">Font choice</h2>
<p><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html">Charter</a> for body text with that 80&rsquo;s corpo document feel. It holds up great on low DPI devices, like screens or consumer printers. This is anachronistic to the late 70&rsquo;s setting of this module, but I really like Charter. Let&rsquo;s say it was created earlier than its publication but its existence was suppressed by CYCLOPS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/Archivo">Archivo</a> for headings and the encounter table numbering. Archivo Expanded turned out to be a decent substitute for <em>FIST</em>&rsquo;s Microgramma branding font at smaller point sizes, compared to common alternatives like <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron">Orbitron</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/cmrfonts.html">Computer Modern Roman Dunhill</a> for the logo. This is a pretty striking font, an artistic alternative to the classic Computer Modern that triggers LaTeX flashbacks in some readers.</p>

<p>I wanted to use <a href="https://speakthesky.itch.io/typeface-dicier">Dicier</a> but I noticed its shortcomings at multiple point sizes (<em>the lines keep changing thickness!</em>), so I slapped together my own <a href="https://github.com/WindowDump/typst-ttrpg/blob/main/disks-n-daemons/template.typ#L26">dice generator function</a>. This gives me full control over the stroke width, corner rounding, and background fill color without resorting to desperate hacks. For consistency and readability, the light dice have a white face with black lines and pips and the dark dice have white pips.</p>
<p>For ease of layout, the function takes a number as its only unnamed argument. The ones digit chooses the number, the tens digit controls rotation (even or odd) and if it&rsquo;s a dark die (2 or more). I was into numeral dice, but after working on this project I&rsquo;ve come around on pips and prefer them now. As long as I&rsquo;m not trying to find the sum of more than 3 dice at once.</p>
<p>I have a template variation of the function to create inline dice the same size as the text, without affecting the layout. I use them as pictograms to make little tables throughout the text.</p>
<h2 id="rounded-corner-inner-radius">Rounded corner inner radius</h2>
<p>Typst support rounding corners on blocks and rectangles. <em>FIST</em> uses rounded corners in some parts of its layout, so I decided to have some fun with it. Making everything be a rounded blob is kinda 90&rsquo;s, and squircles are more 10&rsquo;s, but I thought it looked neat.</p>
<p>Nesting rounded corners gives us a pleasing rounded border. The formula for calculating the inner radius is <code>inner radius = outer radius - thickness</code>. This works in all units (I used points). The formula&rsquo;s floating around the internet, <a href="https://border-radius.bechbox.com">here&rsquo;s an interactive example</a>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h1>
<p>I hacked on a revision 2 by writing this blog post, with an eye for cleaning up the text. A few months distance and now I see all the clunky phrasing, weird structure, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to expand this out into a bigger version that has some art, examples of generation, room variations, maybe boxed text, who knows! The next pamphlet I make should be a bit less high-concept so its content can actually fit and leave room for art.</p>
<h2 id="anti-canon-notes">Anti-canon notes</h2>
<p>The pseudonym <em>JRH</em> is an reference to <a href="https://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html">J. Random Hacker</a>, or &ldquo;some random hacker that is in the way and annoying me.&rdquo; Remember, nobody hates nerds more than other nerds, especially if they&rsquo;re the same type of nerd.</p>
<p>There is no city or country cited for Cambridge &ndash; choose your favorite higher learning institution from any of them.</p>
<p>Thanks to bea from CLAYMORE for mentioning the PSP game <em>Coded Arms</em>, which I stole the term &ldquo;Achiba Syndrome&rdquo; from.</p>
<p>I yoinked the name &ldquo;Ideaspace&rdquo; from <em>Shin Megami Tensei: NINE</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s the VR environment created for people to live in after Tokyo is nuked in <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/WindowDump/typst-ttrpg/blob/main/longshot-city.typ">Source code (Typst)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out <a href="https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/longshot-city">Longshot City</a> on Itch.</p>
<p>The one time I ran this game I had a time-traveling ghost possess an influencer live-streaming a self-replicating robot outbreak so they could use their psychic powers to fight the robots. Later the ghost possessed another hero while he ate drive-thru food so they could both recover with the sustenance.</p>
<h1 id="source-code-discussion">Source code discussion</h1>
<p>This is the first horizontal full-page character sheet I made. I used <a href="https://typst.app">Typst</a>.</p>
<h2 id="font-choice">Font choice</h2>
<p>I went with the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC">Patrick Hand SC</a> font as an easy option for a handwritten font. Kinda like comics. For numbers I used <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/86895479/Comic-Helvetic-(Lat-Cyr)">Comic Helvetic</a>, a blursed cross between Comic Sans and Helvetica. Tables use <a href="https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya">Alegreya</a>, since it&rsquo;s pretty and is similar to the body text in <em>Longshot City</em>.</p>
<h2 id="fun-with-layout">Fun with layout</h2>
<p>I started with a loose facsimile of the official sheet, with the grid evenly split down the center. After a while, I remembered I didn&rsquo;t need to fold the sheet or cut it in half, so I messed around with the grid&rsquo;s column widths, expressed as fractional units (<code>fr</code>). Typst made it easy to adjust the weights. This let me give the skills &amp; powers list and attacks list more room to breathe.</p>
<h2 id="content-from-ranges">Content from ranges</h2>
<p>In the <a href="content/posts/runic-magic.md">Runic Magic</a> project, I used <code>array.map</code> to create content from an array of dictionaries. For this project, I use a <code>for</code> loop over a <code>range()</code>. This lets me easily work with numbered content, such as the labels on the Attacks and Inventory sections of the sheet.</p>
<p>Each iteration of the loop returns a 1-length <code>array</code>, which Typst combines into a single array that I then spread to populate the containing grid.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize you could use the <code>*</code> operator to make copies of content, so there&rsquo;s a few spots where I use this method even though I don&rsquo;t use the iterator variable.</p>
<h2 id="quick-reference-sheet">Quick reference sheet</h2>
<p>An exercise in information density. <em>Longshot City</em> uses per-weapon lookup tables for damage, which you copy onto your character sheet for easy reference. The stamina costs of the various powers aren&rsquo;t noted in the character backgrounds section, and it&rsquo;s inconvenient to flip through the book to find them. The <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> descended rules use a mixture of roll under vs. stat and roll high plus stat, which can be confusing for new players. I fit all the relevant information onto a single page, a reference sheet the table can pass around instead of a device with the PDF is also convenient.</p>

<figure class="webp" ><picture>
          <source srcset="/images/longshot-city-quick-reference_hu7ca8f0ca4b157bb21a41ff6db8c085f4_511366_1349x1044_fit_q75_h2_box_3.webp" type="image/webp">

          <img src="/images/longshot-city-quick-reference_hu7ca8f0ca4b157bb21a41ff6db8c085f4_511366_1349x1044_fit_q75_h2_box_3.webp"alt="Longshot City character sheet"  width="1349"  height="1044"  loading="lazy" />
        </picture></figure>
<p>Nothing tricky for these, just raw brute force. I store the actual table contents in arrays to make them easier to handle &ndash; they&rsquo;re quite long when the code formatter forces each number onto its own line, just your standard comma separated values.</p>
<p>I tried putting all of the game terms in small caps for fun, using Typst show rules. However, since the quick reference is about 50% game terms, this makes it feel like it&rsquo;s shouting at you.</p>
<p>I need to do another editing pass or two on the rules reference &ndash; probably rip out the entire initiative section (&ldquo;let the GM tell you when it&rsquo;s your turn, each combat round is one two-page spread long&rdquo;) to make room for more examples.</p>

<p>Lightweight interpretive magic system. Uses the <a href="https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Incantation">Runes</a> from the classic <em>Ultima</em> CRPG series. These are the building blocks of <a href="https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Britannian_magic">Britiannian magic</a>: each spell is made of one or more runes, and casting them in some games requires you to type in the runes for the spell every time you cast it.</p>
<p>Spells are legally-distinct <em>D&amp;D</em> types, as was the style at the time. The runes to cast them are thematic, with more powerful spells requiring multiple runes. For a few examples, Light is <em><code>In Lor</code></em> &ndash; &ldquo;create light&rdquo;, Fireball is <em><code>Vas Flam Hur</code></em> &ndash; &ldquo;great flame wind&rdquo;, and Resurrect is <em><code>In Mani Corp</code></em> &ndash; &ldquo;create life death.&rdquo; Poke around the <a href="https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Category:Ultima_VII_spells">Ultima VII spell list</a> for more.</p>
<p>Because I could fit it, this document has instructions on how to use it as a <a href="https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist">FIST</a> trait. For completeness&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="runic-magic">RUNIC MAGIC</h2>
<p>You are a practitioner of a magical art that uses runes as its fundamental unit. These 24 runes can be represented as cards on <a href="https://github.com/WindowDump/typst-ttrpg/blob/main/runic-magic.pdf">the second page of this document</a>. Assemble them into a deck (allows for repeated random drawing with no duplicates).</p>
<p>When you have time for meditation and connection with the sources of your power, such as between missions or at certain rendezvous points, return all your runes to the deck, shuffle, and draw <strong>2D6 + your number of traits</strong> runes. Once used, a rune loses power until you draw runes.</p>
<p>To cast a spell, choose one or more runes to form the basis of a reasonable spell. Casting a spell is always <em>risky</em>, roll <strong>2D6 + modifiers</strong> (see below) like other risky actions to see if there is a complication or if the spell turns out badly.</p>
<p>By default, a spell takes 30-60 seconds to cast, lasts for a single use or with active concentration, and affects you or someone you touch in a noticeable way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <strong>+ 1</strong> to the roll for each:
<ul>
<li>Use more than 2 runes in the spell</li>
<li>Sacrifice 1D6 HP</li>
<li>Take much longer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subtract <strong>- 1</strong> from the roll for each:
<ul>
<li>Increase range</li>
<li>Affect group or area</li>
<li>Cast instantly</li>
<li>Subtle effect and casting</li>
<li>Long-lasting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Trait bonus: +1 MAX HP</p>

<li><a href="../../stuff/fist-operative-handbook.typ">Source Code (Typst)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Branching off from <em>FIST</em>, I found the neat <a href="https://itch.io/c/3165867/pbta-osr-synthesis">PbtA + OSR collection on Itch</a> that contains a bunch of games inspired by <a href="https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons">World of Dungeons</a> (<em>WoDu</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), the <em>Dungeon World</em> pre-order bonus that&rsquo;s basically <em>B/X D&amp;D</em> but you do the 2d6 thing from <em>Apocalypse World</em> instead of a d20. Among the collection is <a href="https://katamoiran.itch.io/remix">Remix</a> (<em>WoDu Remix</em>) which neatly splits the difference between the OSR, storygames, and <em>5e</em>, and makes me excited every time I crack it open.</p>
<p>After finishing up the <em>FIST</em> character sheet and understanding the basics of <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>, I decided to try a <em>WoDu Remix</em> sheet since the two games are similar. Taking the original <em>WoDu</em> sheet as inspiration, I added the new skill list, provided more room for special abilities, and included the extra stats and fields (heritage, bonus damage, first aid, debilities).</p>
<p>During the process I realized I could build a sheet out of negative space on top of a colored background, working around Typst&rsquo;s lack of masking or clipping support. This let me make some fairly striking designs with gradients on the borders. Typst comes loaded with a bunch of cool data visualization gradients (<code>flare</code> is a standout) and it&rsquo;s easy to make your own.</p>
<p>I made a few different versions of the sheet. First up is classic <em>black &amp; white</em>, which would look good out of a laser printer.</p>

          </figcaption></figure>
<p>Next is a high-contrast, lower ink version. It features only black text and a <code>0.25pt</code> stroke around the small boxes players write in. This is suitable for ink-jet printers and photocopiers. You may also find it easier to read.</p>

<figure class="webp" ><a href="../../stuff/wodu-remix-sheet-halfletter-lowink.pdf"><picture>

          </figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, we have one with the <code>flare</code> gradient from Typst, a yellow to purple gradient that is perceptibly uniform with colors reminsicient of a sunset. I added a chrome text effect to the header text as well.</p>

<figure class="webp" ><a href="../../stuff/wodu-remix-sheet-halfletter-flare.pdf"><picture>
          <source srcset="/images/wodu-remix-sheet-halfletter-flare_huc8a94e1ef92101a27bcbdc4167bd8e7f_366276_1860x1426_fit_q75_h2_box_3.webp" type="image/webp">

          </figcaption></figure>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to riff on these, if you have Typst set up download the source code and try playing with it. Try changing the color of the grid, or messing with a gradient, or applying an image or pattern, etc. You can also change the fonts if you decide Trebuchet is more your speed than Jost, for example.</p>
<p>If you want to start making your own <em>WoDu</em> hack, you could start by editing this character sheet! Change the attributes to something more flavorful, choose skills that model the world you&rsquo;re playing in, decide what stats you need, and keep going! You&rsquo;ll be ready for playtesting in no time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist">FIST</a>, a TTRPG about paranormal mercenaries (think <em>Metal Gear</em>) doing jobs for regular people no one else can (or no one else wants to) during the Cold War (think <em>The A-Team</em>). One of my favorite parts is how quickly a character can be generated, and how flavorful these characters are. Check out <a href="https://fistref.com/random-merc">FISTREF&rsquo;s Random Merc page</a> if you want to see it in action for yourself. FIST&rsquo;s anti-canon sandbox defines the world with the help of the characters.</p>
<p>FIST&rsquo;s core is short and concise, and I decided to combine a rules reference and a character sheet together for a zine-style booklet. This is particularly useful for new players who haven&rsquo;t read the player rules yet. You can read both sides, follow the character creation rules on the outside, then fold it in half to maximize table space.</p>
<p>This was a first project in <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> so there&rsquo;s probably a lot of ugly hacks in there - I might clean it up later. Possible project for the reader: replace Orbitron and Michroma with Microgramma (aka the <em>Drake &amp; Josh</em> font), update letter-spacing as needed.</p>
<p>I also made a version that&rsquo;s just the character sheet twice, so you can print out two character sheets at once!</p>
<p>This is kind of a cool format for a one-page game that was surprisingly easy to whip up.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[test post please ignore]]></description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="this-is-a-test-post">This is a test post</h2>
<p>Hello. This is a post that I might mark as a draft in the near future. It&rsquo;s a testing post that demonstrates various features of this blog and the styles defined for it. I care way too much about this stuff, but I&rsquo;m getting it out of the way so I don&rsquo;t get distracted by it later (I will get distracted by layout and formatting stuff later).</p>
<p><del>A lot of this website is me playing with <a href="https://psb1558.github.io/Elstob-font/">Elstob</a>, a font based on one used by the Oxford University Press in the 17th century. With the power of modern technology it graces your eyeballs once again, except this time with an anachronistic grade axis. It&rsquo;s an old style font, so it&rsquo;s designed for black ink on white paper, but maybe white pixels on dark pixels will be good too.</del></p>
<p>Just kidding, decided to swap over to <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif">Source Serif 4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/Drafting">Drafting* Mono</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hot-new-features">Hot New Features</h3>
<p>I added these because Elstob supports them. They&rsquo;re implemented as Hugo shortcodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insular mode
<ul>
<li>Uses insular letter shapes and caps to small caps.
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-feature-settings: 'c2sc', 'ss02'">It&rsquo;s kinda like that movie, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</span></li>
<li>source serif: c2sc works! insular doesn&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elder Futhark mode
<ul>
<li>24 Norse runes, maps to  English letters. Q is mapped to K, Y is mapped to I, X is mapped to G.
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-feature-settings: 'ss13'">runic probabli makes more sense than english tbkh</span></li>
<li>
<span style="font-feature-settings: 'ss13'">we <em>ultima</em> now</span></li>
<li>maybe not anymore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-feature-settings: 'ss13'">abcdefghijklm nopkrstuvwgiz abcdefghijklm nopkrstuvwgiz</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed syntax highlighting style
<ul>
<li>Slammed <a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki">Flexoki</a> on the site. I dunno, I dig the high contrast inky colors of that theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="todo">todo</h3>
<p>Here is a wishlist of things I&rsquo;d like to do in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rollable tables
<ul>
<li>Display a table along with two buttons: &ldquo;get 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;get 5&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Usable as a game aid or prep aid!
<ul>
<li>Bonus round: Use <a href="https://speakthesky.itch.io/typeface-dicier">Dicier</a> to style the table entries for D66 (36), D63 (18), or D33 (9) tables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I get to practice making tables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A large number of imperceptable changes you will never notice but I can&rsquo;t stop staring at.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m a real typographer now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Theme is based on <a href="https://1bl4z3r.github.io/hermit-V2/en/">Hermit V2</a>. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of hacking to it because I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://practicaltypography.com">Butterick&rsquo;s Practical Typography</a>.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> website!</p>
<h1 id="level-1-testing">Level 1 testing</h1>
<p>Butterick recommends 45 to 90 characters per line. Here are lines of 26, 52, and 78 characters.</p>
<p>abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz</p>
<p>abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz</p>
<p>abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz abcde fghij klmno pqrst uvwxyz</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all like oldstyle numerals? 1234567890</p>
<p>Personally I have a soft spot for those suckers. We see lining numerals everywhere, every day - they&rsquo;ve been the default for so long. Same with tabular numerals. If you&rsquo;re making a chart or a table, or working with monospace fonts, tabular lining numerals are the way to go, and they&rsquo;ve become so commonplace they don&rsquo;t look odd when you see them in text. So they&rsquo;re a reasonable default. But I&rsquo;m not using the default settings! I want to go wild and so something you haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>

<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
