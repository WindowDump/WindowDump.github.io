      <description>Runic Magic - PDF Source code (Typst) Original text by skander. Shout out to skander&amp;rsquo;s itch, get his version of this document to double your runes.&#xA;Lightweight interpretive magic system. Uses the Runes from the classic Ultima CRPG series. These are the building blocks of Britiannian magic: each spell is made of one or more runes, and casting them in some games requires you to type in the runes for the spell every time you cast it.</description>

      <description>flare gradient version&#xA;Black &amp;amp; White - PDF Low Ink, Single Contrast - PDF flare, color - PDF Source Code (Typst) Branching off from FIST, I found the neat PbtA + OSR collection on Itch that contains a bunch of games inspired by World of Dungeons (WoDu1), the Dungeon World pre-order bonus that&amp;rsquo;s basically B/X D&amp;amp;D but you do the 2d6 thing from Apocalypse World instead of a d20. Among the collection is Remix (WoDu Remix) which neatly splits the difference between the OSR, storygames, and 5e, and makes me excited every time I crack it open.</description>

      <description>FIST Operative Handbook - PDF FIST half-letter character sheet - PDF Source Code (Typst) I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of FIST, a TTRPG about paranormal mercenaries (think Metal Gear) doing jobs for regular people no one else can (or no one else wants to) during the Cold War (think The A-Team). One of my favorite parts is how quickly a character can be generated, and how flavorful these characters are. Check out FISTREF&amp;rsquo;s Random Merc page if you want to see it in action for yourself.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some game stuff I made. Source is provided so you can tweak or hack them to your liking. Change fonts, change colors, tweak the words, build a game on top of it. Or print them out and start playing.&#xA;FIST FIST - Freelance Infantry Strike Team, a paranormal mercenary TTRPG.&#xA;Operative Handbook Half-letter character sheet, plus character creation rules and a rules reference. Great for new players - read the whole thing, then make a character and fold it in half to maximize table space.</description>

      <description>This is a test post Hello. This is a post that I might mark as a draft in the near future. It&amp;rsquo;s a testing post that demonstrates various features of this blog and the styles defined for it. I care way too much about this stuff, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting it out of the way so I don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by it later (I will get distracted by layout and formatting stuff later).</description>

      <description>My handle is Window Dump (check your man pages to learn more about me, I just output the content of a window to a file in text format). I like computers. I figured out how to program them and get them to do increasingly silly stuff - this blog and its content is just the latest example.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for my old fork of KeyZen, a tool used to practice keyboard layouts (i.</description>
