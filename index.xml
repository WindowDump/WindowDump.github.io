      <description>This is a test post Hello. This is a post that I might mark as a draft in the near future. It&amp;rsquo;s a testing post that demonstrates various features of this blog and the styles defined for it. I care way too much about this stuff, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting it out of the way so I don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by it later (I will get distracted by layout and formatting stuff later).</description>

      <description>My handle is Window Dump (check your man pages to learn more about me). I like computers. I figured out how to program them and get them to do increasingly silly stuff - this blog and its content is just the latest example.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for my hilariously outdated fork of KeyZen, a tool used to practice keyboard layouts (i.e., Dvorak, Colemak, Hands Down), you can find it right here, in the usual location.</description>
